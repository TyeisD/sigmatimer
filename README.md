SigmaTimer
Overview

SigmaTimer is a lightweight timer application designed to support focused work and study sessions. The project implements basic time-based logic to manage and track timed intervals, emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and usability.

This project was developed as a small software exercise to practice application structure, event handling, and timing control.

Features

Timer-based session control

Start, pause, and reset functionality

Simple and minimal user interaction

Clear separation between timing logic and interface behavior

Implementation

The project focuses on implementing time-based logic using programmatic timers rather than external frameworks. Core functionality includes tracking elapsed time, updating timer states, and handling user-triggered events.

The implementation prioritizes readability and maintainability, making the code easy to understand and extend.

Use Cases

Study or work session timing

Productivity tracking

Practice with time-based application logic

Technologies

Programming language: (use the language in your project, e.g., Python / JavaScript)

Core concepts: timing logic, state management, event handling

How to Run

Clone the repository

Follow the instructions in the source files to start the timer

Interact with the application using the provided controls

Notes

This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes. It focuses on foundational programming concepts related to time management rather than advanced productivity features.
